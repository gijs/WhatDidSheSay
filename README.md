##Introduction
WhatDidSheSay is a Siri based iOS application, created to pop the iOS fart app bubble. Unfortunately, it was denied by Apple numerous times and has thus failed :(

##How to use
The app has two screens: WDSS and Nearby.

If your device supports Siri dictation, a microphone button is displayed. Press it and the app will listen in on conversation, saying 'That's What She Said' where appropriate. Those without dictation support have the option to type in phrases to verify if they are in fact valid 'that's what she said's.

The nearby tab allows you to see where that's what she saids are occurring nearby. I'm using Parse.com for this and have included my client and app ids in the repo so everyone can enjoy it. Please don't abuse them.

##Installation
Simply open the Xcode project and build & run on your device.
